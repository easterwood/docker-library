## Do you have the following experience when trying to have the latest git on CentOS?

* I don't want to install a bunch of *-devel, gcc, make... to build the latest git.

## If yes, we are friend but

* You need to use Docker. Yes, this is the cons.
* The pros is you don't have to install tons of dependencies on your host.
* The size of these dependencies must be lesser than Docker stuff.

## Hope you guys like it

* `make dist`
